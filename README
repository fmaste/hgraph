A graph library (weigth, directed and multi variants).
The graph is represented by two structures:
	- The adjacency:
		This structure contains for each node a list with its predecessors and another one with its successors.
		This index allows to make fasters connection queries at the cost of the extra storage space.
	- The labels:
		This structure contains the labels associated with each edge or arc.
		Allows to handle multiple edges with different data indepently of the adjacency.
