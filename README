A graph library (weigth, directed and multi variants).

I highly value graphs as a structure that can model many complex problem and have a strong theoretic background.

I am building many types of collections that will be useful to build my graph library.

The graph is represented by two structures:
	- The adjacency:
		This structure contains for each node a list with its predecessors and another one with its successors.
		This index allows to make fasters connection queries at the cost of the extra storage space.
	- The labels:
		This structure contains the labels associated with each edge or arc.
		Allows to handle multiple edges with different data indepently of the adjacency.
